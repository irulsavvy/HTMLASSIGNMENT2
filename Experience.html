    <p><strong>18/5/2025</strong> - My first car crash. It was a shocking event in my life. My car suddenly lost control
      on a corner; I couldn't control the car and the steering was free. Finally, my car hit the divider and slid until
      it stopped by itself. But luckily, I'm fine and could walk out of it. Alhamdulillah.</p>

    <p><strong>10/9/2022</strong> - The day that I lost my other half. It was a sad and numb day. My father was on his
      way to work and collapsed at his parking lot workplace. My mother called me to inform me that my father had
      collapsed. All of us gathered and went to the hospital where my father was located. But when we arrived, it was
      too late. My father had already passed away. The scar is still deep inside me, and the memories keep lingering.
      But what can we do as humans? Just move on with life and pray for the best. Al-Fatihah, Abah.</p>
